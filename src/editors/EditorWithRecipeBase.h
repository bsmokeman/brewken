/**
 * \brief Extends \c EditorBase for editors where it makes sense for us to be able to watch a \c Recipe, because a
 *        \c Recipe can have at most one of the thing we are editing (\c Boil, \c Equipment, \c Fermentation, \c Mash,
 *        \c Style).
 *
 *        Classes deriving from this one have the same requirements as those deriving directly from \c EditorBase,
 *        except that:
 *           EDITOR_WITH_RECIPE_COMMON_DECL should be placed in the header file instead of EDITOR_COMMON_DECL
 *           EDITOR_WITH_RECIPE_COMMON_CODE should be placed in the .cpp   file instead of EDITOR_COMMON_CODE
